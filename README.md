# Vulcaner V1 Beta
Vulcaner is a roblox executor template for roblox executors that need APIs.
###### for this executor to work you need to download an API such as WRD or EasyXploits ( which are down right now. )

# UI
Here is a picture of what the UI looks like!

Pretty cool huh?

Sadly it won't work, BUT I'm learning C# & C++ and I might be able to make it work without the need of APIs!

### might work with YoutubeCE or Chaos V3....

Here is the download to all of the executors that will work with this.
YoutubeCE - https://github.com/ScriptTestAdvanced/YouTubeCE-injector/releases/tag/v1.4.5
NetflixCE - https://github.com/vlorb/NetflixCE
Chaos V5/V3 - https://discord.gg/chaosploit

All of these Exploits have been tested in TotalVirus down below.
